sailfishos-patch-restore-swipe-to-lock
======================================

The new SailfishOS UI removes the swipe to lock functionality.
This patch restores it, without dropping the new "PowerKey menu".

A full swipe from the top will work as usual (the menu remains accessible).

Works on SailfishOS 1.1.9+.
